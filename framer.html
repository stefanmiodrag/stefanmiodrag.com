<strong>Taking a look at Framer as a design tool and comparing it to Sketch</strong>

<blockquote>Preface: I’m comparing the tools in their current states.
Keep in mind that Framer’s team has mentioned that vector and exporting,
along with other handy features, are in the works.</blockquote>
<br />––

<p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could use a single design tool to go
from sketching to wireframing to a finished prototype? <i>Well…</i>
there is a tool for the entire design workflow and it’s called Framer.
Framer makes it really easy to create designs from scratch, visualize
interactions, and experiment with user flows.</p>

<p>The design tab in Framer is still quite new and has a long way to
go before it can compete against well-established tools like Sketch.
In this article I’ll compare the two and highlight where each tool shines.<p>
<br />––<br />
	
<strong>Platform and Compatibility</strong>
	
<p>Sketch is currently only available on systems that operate on macOs.
That means that anyone who would like to work with or even view your design on
any other operating system is out of luck.</p>
	
<p>Framer is in the same boat at the moment. But compared to Sketch,
it seems like they’re at least planning on releasing a windows version
in the future.<p>

<blockquote>“We do not currently have a version for Windows, you can
sign up to be notified once we launch it.”</blockquote>
	
<p>Something worth noting is that Framer’s mobile preview
<a href="https://framer.com/teams/" target="_blank">is available
on both iOS and Android.</a> Sketch’s Mirror on the other hand is only
accessible on iOS devices.</p>
<br />––<br />
	
<strong>Exporting and Developer Handoff</strong>	
	
<p>Framer doesn’t support exporting yet, but it does have a collaboration
feature that allows you to easily create a shareable link like Sketch’s Cloud.
Spec’ing is unfortunately also unavailable. At the moment you’re only able to
copy the native values of an interaction.</p>
	
<p>But don’t worry! The Framer team has confirmed that they intend to
release this feature in the upcoming weeks.</p>
	
<p>Sketch has both features. You can conveniently copy the CSS attributes
or SVG code of any element. There’s also plenty of apps that integrate with
Sketch, making developer handoff easy.</p>
<br />––<br />
	
<strong>User interface and Usability</strong>

<p>Framer looks and feels a lot like Sketch, which makes for an easier
transition for anyone who has previously used Sketch.</p>

<p>The left panel in both tools is used for the same purpose, but
the way they function is quite different. We all know how quickly your
‘contents’ panel in Sketch can get overwhelming and busy.</p>

<p>That’s why in Framer your left panel only shows you art boards that
you have present on your canvas. Clicking on an art board in the left panel
will not display its content. You instead have to click on the actual art
board to focus on it. I could see this becoming an issue when working on
larger projects where it might be difficult to find that <i>one specific art board</i>.</p>
	
<p>You’ll also notice that once you actually focus on an art board, the
rest of the boards in the left panel disappear. I like this feature since
it forces you to focus on what’s at hand, but I also have a couple of issues with this:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn’t give you a straightforward and immediate overview, which
is what I use the panel for in Sketch.</li>
	
<li>It doesn’t allow you to conveniently make changes straight from the left panel.</li>
</ul>
	
<p>Framer makes up for this, however, with their automated layer nesting, which
works very well. You’re able to focus on designing rather than managing and
messing around with layers.</p>

	
<p>The automated layers do most of the dirty work, but if you want to group
something together you’ll have to create a new ‘parent’. It works almost the
same way, except you aren’t able to minimize or hide the contents of a parent.
This could become an issue when dealing with a lot of elements.</p>

<p>Since Framer is more lightweight on features, everything you need is within
reach. You don’t have to dig around in your menu bar and it’s actually quite a
refreshing change from the busy interface you’ll find when you stare at Sketch.</p>
