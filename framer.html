<blockquote>Preface: I’m comparing the tools in their current states.
Keep in mind that Framer’s team has mentioned that vector and exporting,
along with other handy features, are in the works.</blockquote>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could use a single design tool to go
from sketching to wireframing to a finished prototype? <i>Well…</i>
there is a tool for the entire design workflow and it’s called Framer.
Framer makes it really easy to create designs from scratch, visualize
interactions, and experiment with user flows.</p>

<p>The design tab in Framer is still quite new and has a long way to
go before it can compete against well-established tools like Sketch.
In this article I’ll compare the two and highlight where each tool shines.<p>
