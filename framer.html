<p>Taking a look at Framer as a design tool and comparing it to Sketch</p>

<blockquote>Preface: I’m comparing the tools in their current states.
Keep in mind that Framer’s team has mentioned that vector and exporting,
along with other handy features, are in the works.</blockquote>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could use a single design tool to go
from sketching to wireframing to a finished prototype? <i>Well…</i>
there is a tool for the entire design workflow and it’s called Framer.
Framer makes it really easy to create designs from scratch, visualize
interactions, and experiment with user flows.</p>

<p>The design tab in Framer is still quite new and has a long way to
go before it can compete against well-established tools like Sketch.
In this article I’ll compare the two and highlight where each tool shines.<p>

<strong>Platform and Compatibility</strong>
	
<p>Sketch is currently only available on systems that operate on macOs.
That means that anyone who would like to work with or even view your design on
any other operating system is out of luck.</p>
	
<p>Framer is in the same boat at the moment. But compared to Sketch,
it seems like they’re at least planning on releasing a windows version
in the future.<p>

<blockquote>“We do not currently have a version for Windows, you can
sign up to be notified once we launch it.”</blockquote>
	
<p>Something worth noting is that Framer’s mobile preview
<a href="https://framer.com/teams/" target="_blank">is available
on both iOS and Android.</a> Sketch’s Mirror on the other hand is only
accessible on iOS devices.</p>
